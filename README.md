## Architecture & Technologies
- **Language**: Java  
- **UI**: Java Swing (or JavaFX, depending on implementation) for the graphical interface  
- **Storage**: Flat files or embedded database (e.g., SQLite)—confirm in code or `Project File.docx`  
- **Design Patterns**: MVC (Model‑View‑Controller) or similar paradigms for separation of concerns

Usage
After successfully setting up and running the University Management System, you can interact with the application as follows:

Launching the Application

Start the application by running the main class (e.g., Main.java). This will open the main window with the dashboard.

Navigation

The interface provides clear navigation menus or sidebars to access different modules:

Students: Add new student records, update existing information, search for students, and delete records.

Teachers: Manage teacher profiles including qualifications, subjects taught, and contact details.

Examinations: Schedule exams, enter exam results, and generate report cards.

Attendance: Record daily attendance for students and staff. View monthly or term-wise attendance summaries.

Leave Management: Submit leave requests for students and teachers, review pending approvals, and update leave status.

Fees: Generate fee invoices, track payments, apply discounts or fines, and produce fee reports.

Performing CRUD Operations

For each module, you can create, read, update, and delete records with intuitive buttons and form inputs.

Validation is typically in place to prevent incorrect data entry (e.g., date formats, mandatory fields).

Reports & Summaries

Use the reporting feature to generate summaries such as fee payment statuses, attendance percentage, or exam performance.

These reports can often be exported (PDF, CSV) or printed for administrative purposes.

Error Handling & Notifications

The system provides feedback messages on success or failure of actions.

Alerts may appear for missing data, invalid operations, or confirmation prompts before deletions.
